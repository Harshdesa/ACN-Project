# ACN-Project
In  this project,  you  will  implement  an  application  layer  multicast  distribution  system  for  a network environment as  an  extension  to  the  system in  Homework  1.  The  server (multicast-server) will  be responsible for building and managing the multicast distribution tree structure.The server can support up to five multicast streams going toward proxies. Each proxy can support up to five streams going toward its local clients within their network and can support up to three multicast streams going to other proxies as  their  external  children  on  the  tree. When  there  is a  sender  (i.e.,  client)  who  want  to  send  data  to  a multicast group, the sender will send its data to the proxy in its domain. The proxy then will forward this data to the multicast-server. The multicast server will then forward the data on the corresponding tree. All join and leave requests by the clients will be made to their proxies. When a proxy receives a join request from a client for a multicast group for which the proxy is not yet a member of, then the proxy will contact the server to graft on the corresponding multicast tree. If the proxy is already on the tree, then the proxy will include this new client into its children set as long as the proxy has extra bandwidth to support this child (remember the proxy can support up to five streams/children).
